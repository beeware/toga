# The coverage settings in this file only control `coverage report`. `coverage run` and
# `coverage combine` are controlled by the pyproject.toml files in each package's
# subdirectory.
#
# In each subdirectory's pyproject.toml, we use both of the following settings:
#   * `source_pkgs`: detects the given packages no matter where they're imported from.
#   * `source`: detects all files in the given directory, including files that are
#      never imported by the tests.
#
# When running through `tox`, this will produce duplicate entries which must be merged
# with `coverage combine`.
