toga-uwp
========

A Universal Windows Platform (UWP) backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_.

**Toga requires Python 3**

**THIS IS A PLACEHOLDER PROJECT**

At present, it has no functionality - it exists purely to reserve the PyPI namespace.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the core Toga library`_.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.
