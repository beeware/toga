   :exclude: {0: '(?!^(MultilineTextInput|Component)$)'}

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import toga

    textbox = toga.MultilineTextInput()
    textbox.value = "Some text.\nIt can be multiple lines of text."

The input can be provided a placeholder value - this is a value that will be
displayed to the user as a prompt for appropriate content for the widget. This
placeholder will only be displayed if the widget has no content; as soon as
a value is provided (either by the user, or programmatically), the placeholder
content will be hidden.

Notes
-----

* Winforms does not support the use of partially or fully transparent colors
  for the MultilineTextInput background. If a color with an alpha value is
  provided (including ``TRANSPARENT``), the alpha channel will be ignored.
  A ``TRANSPARENT`` background will be rendered as white.
