The canvas is used for creating a blank widget that you can draw on.

Usage
-----

Simple usage to draw a black circle on the screen using the arc drawing object:

.. code-block:: Python

    import toga
    canvas = toga.Canvas(style=Pack(flex=1))
    box = toga.Box(children=[canvas])
    with canvas.fill() as fill:
        fill.arc(50, 50, 15)

More advanced usage for something like a vector drawing app where you would
want to modify the parameters of the drawing objects. Here we draw a black
circle and black rectangle. We then change the size of the circle, move the
rectangle, and finally delete the rectangle.

.. code-block:: Python

    import toga
    canvas = toga.Canvas(style=Pack(flex=1))
    box = toga.Box(children=[canvas])
    with canvas.fill() as fill:
        arc1 = fill.arc(x=50, y=50, radius=15)
        rect1 = fill.rect(x=50, y=50, width=15, height=15)

    arc1.x, arc1.y, arc1.radius = (25, 25, 5)
    rect1.x = 75
    fill.remove(rect1)

Use of drawing contexts, for example with a platformer game. Here you would
want to modify the x/y coordinate of a drawing context that draws each
character on the canvas. First, we create a hero context. Next, we create a
black circle and a black outlined rectangle for the hero's body. Finally, we
move the hero by 10 on the x-axis.

.. code-block:: Python

    import toga
    canvas = toga.Canvas(style=Pack(flex=1))
    box = toga.Box(children=[canvas])
    with canvas.context() as hero:
        with hero.fill() as body:
            body.arc(50, 50, 15)
        with hero.stroke() as outline:
            outline.rect(50, 50, 15, 15)

    hero.translate(10, 0)
