Accessor names (whether explicitly provided, or automatically generated from the header
names) should be unique. If they are not, column data will be duplicated, as Toga has no
way to tell which version of an accessor to use when populating data for a column.

The value provided by an accessor is interpreted as follows:

* If the value is a :any:`Widget`, that widget will be displayed in the cell. Note that
  this is currently a beta API: see the Notes section.

* If the value is a :any:`tuple`, it must have two elements: an icon, and a second
  element which will be interpreted as one of the options below.

* If the value is ``None``, then ``missing_value`` will be displayed.

* Any other value will be converted into a string. If an icon has not already been
  provided in a tuple, it can also be provided using the value's ``icon`` attribute.

Icon values must either be an :any:`Icon`, which will be displayed on the left of the
cell, or ``None`` to display no icon.
