Keys
====

A symbolic representation of keys used for keyboard shortcuts.

Most keys have a constant that matches the text on the key, or the name of the
key if the text on the key isn't a legal Python identifier.

However, due to differences between platforms, there's no representation of
"modifier" keys like Control, Command, Option, or the Windows Key. Instead, Toga
provides three generic modifier constants, and maps those to the modifier keys,
matching the precedence with which they are used on the underlying platforms:

========== ============== ============== ==================
 Platform   :any:`MOD_1`   :any:`MOD_2`   :any:`MOD_3`
========== ============== ============== ==================
 Linux      Control        Alt            Tux/Windows/Meta
 macOS      Command (âŒ˜)    Option         Control (^)
 Windows    Control        Alt            Not supported
========== ============== ============== ==================

Key combinations can be expressed by combining multiple ``Key`` values with the
``+`` operator.

.. code-block:: python

    from toga import Key

    just_an_a = Key.A
    shift_a = Key.SHIFT + Key.A
    # Windows/Linux - Control-Shift-A:
    # macOS - Command-Shift-A:
    modified_shift_a = Key.MOD_1 + Key.SHIFT + Key.A

The order of addition is not significant. ``Key.SHIFT + Key.A`` and ``Key.A +
Key.SHIFT`` will produce the same key representation.
