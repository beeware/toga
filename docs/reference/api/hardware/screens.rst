Screen
======

A representation of a screen attached to a device.

.. rst-class:: widget-support
.. csv-filter:: Availability (:ref:`Key <api-status-key>`)
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: ../../data/widgets_by_platform.csv
   :included_cols: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10
   :include: {0: '^Screen$'}

Usage
-----

An app will always have access to at least one screen. The :any:`toga.App.screens`
attribute will return the list of all available screens; the screen at index 0 will be
the "primary" screen. Screen sizes and positions are given in CSS pixels.

.. code-block:: python

    # Print the size of the primary screen.
    print(my_app.screens[0].size)

    # Print the identifying name of the second screen
    print(my_app.screens[1].name)

Notes
-----

* When using the GTK backend under Wayland, the screen at index 0 may not be the primary
  screen. This because the separation of concerns enforced by Wayland makes determining
  the primary screen unreliable.
