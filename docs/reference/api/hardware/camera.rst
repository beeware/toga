Usage
-----

Cameras attached to a device running an app can be accessed using the
:attr:`~toga.App.camera` attribute. This attribute exposes an API that allows you to
check if you have have permission to access the camera device; and if permission exists,
capture photographs.

The Camera API is *asynchronous*. This means the methods that have long-running behavior
(such as requesting permissions and taking photographs) must be ``await``-ed, rather
than being invoked directly. This means they must be invoked from inside an asynchronous
handler:

.. code-block:: python

    import toga

    class MyApp(toga.App):
        ...
        async def time_for_a_selfie(self, widget, **kwargs):
            photo = await self.camera.take_photo()

Most platforms will require some form of device permission to access the camera. The
permission APIs are paired with the specific actions performed on those APIs - that is,
to take a photo, you require :any:`Camera.has_permission`, which you can request using
:any:`Camera.request_permission()`.

Toga will confirm whether the app has been granted permission to use the camera before
invoking any camera API. If permission has not yet been granted, the platform *may*
request access at the time of first camera access; however, this is not guaranteed to be
the behavior on all platforms.

Notes
-----

* Apps that use a camera must be configured to provide permission to the camera device.
  The permissions required are platform specific:

  * iOS: ``NSCameraUsageDescription`` must be defined in the app's ``Info.plist`` file.
  * macOS: The ``com.apple.security.device.camera`` entitlement must be enabled, and
    ``NSCameraUsageDescription`` must be defined in the app's ``Info.plist`` file.
  * Android: The ``android.permission.CAMERA`` permission must be declared.

* The iOS simulator implements the iOS Camera APIs, but is not able to take photographs.
  To test your app's Camera usage, you must use a physical iOS device.
