Why "Toga"? Why the Yak?
========================

So... why the name Toga?
========================

We all know the aphorism that `"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."`_

.. _"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.": http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/when_in_Rome_do_as_the_Romans_do

So - what does a well dressed Roman wear? A toga, of course! And what does a
well dressed Python app wear? Toga!

So... why the yak mascot?
=========================

It's a reflection of the long running joke about `yak shaving`_ in computer
programming. The story originally comes from MIT, and is related to a
Ren and Stimpy episode; over the years, the story has evolved, and now goes
something like this:

    You want to borrow your neighbor's hose so you can wash your car. But you
    remember that last week, you broke their rake, so you need to go to the
    hardware store to buy a new one. But that means driving to the hardware
    store, so you have to look for your keys. You eventually find your keys
    inside a tear in a cushion - but you can't leave the cushion torn,
    because the dog will destroy the cushion if they find a little tear. The
    cushion needs a little more stuffing before it can be repaired, but it's
    a special cushion filled with exotic Tibetan yak hair.

    The next thing you know, you're standing on a hillside in Tibet shaving a
    yak. And all you wanted to do was wash your car.

An easy to use widget toolkit is the yak standing in the way of progress of a
number of BeeWare_ projects, and the original creator of Toga has been tinkering
with various widget toolkits for over 20 years, so the metaphor seemed
appropriate.
