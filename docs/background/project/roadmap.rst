Toga's Road Map
===============

Toga is a new project - we have lots of things that we'd like to do. If
you'd like to contribute, you can provide a patch for one of these features.

Widgets
-------

The core of Toga is its widget set. Modern GUI apps have lots of native
controls that need to be represented. The following widgets have no
representation at present, and need to be added.

There's also the task of porting widgets available on one platform to
another platform.

Input
~~~~~

Inputs are mechanisms for displaying and editing input provided by the user.

Partially implemented widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``Table``

  Mobile platforms don't provide a native "Table" widget; however, table-like
  data could be rendered by using a :class:`~toga.DetailedList`, where the
  title and subtitle are the "important" columns selected by the user, and
  selecting a row on the table navigates to a sub-page showing the full row
  detail.

* ``Tree``

  As with Table, mobile platforms don't provide a native "Tree" widget; however,
  we could use a similar approach to Table.

  On Windows, the native widget doesn't provide support for more than one column. This
  means we either need to make a special case on Windows for a "simple" tree; or we need
  to form a composite widget that pairs the scrolling of a table with a tree.

* ``DateTimeInput`` - A widget for selecting a date and a time.

  - Cocoa: ``NSDatePicker``
  - GTK: ``Gtk.Calendar`` + ?
  - iOS: ``UIDatePicker``

New widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``RadioButton`` - a set of mutually exclusive options.

  Functionally, the use case of "select one from a list of options" can be met with a
  :class:`~toga.Selection`; however, from a UI design perspective, a radio button is a
  common design pattern.

  See `this issue <https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/2225>`__ for discussion of how
  this widget may be implemented in a way that compliments existing widgets.

* ``ComboBox`` - A free entry text field that provides options (e.g., text with past choices)

  - Cocoa: ``NSComboBox``
  - GTK: ``Gtk.ComboBox.new_with_model_and_entry``
  - iOS: ?
  - Winforms: ``ComboBox``
  - Android: ``Spinner``

* ``ColorInput`` - A widget for selecting a color

  - Cocoa: ``NSColorWell``
  - GTK: ``Gtk.ColorButton`` or ``Gtk.ColorSelection``
  - iOS: ?
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

* ``SearchInput`` - A variant of ``TextField`` that is decorated as a search box.

  - Cocoa: ``NSSearchField``
  - GTK: ``Gtk.Entry``
  - iOS: ``UISearchBar``?
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

Views
~~~~~

Views are mechanisms for displaying rich content,
usually in a read-only manner.

* ``VideoView`` - Display a video

  - Cocoa: ``AVPlayerView``
  - GTK: Custom integration with ``GStreamer``
  - iOS: ``MPMoviePlayerController``
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

* ``PDFView`` - Display a PDF document

  - Cocoa: ``PDFView``
  - GTK: ?
  - iOS: Integration with QuickLook?
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

Container widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Containers are widgets that can contain other widgets.

* ``FormContainer`` - A layout for a "key/value" or "label/widget" form

  - Cocoa: ``NSForm``, or ``NSView`` with pre-set constraints.
  - GTK:
  - iOS:
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

* ``NavigationContainer`` - A container view that holds a navigable tree of sub-views

  Essentially a view that has a "back" button to return to the previous view
  in a hierarchy. Example of use: Top level navigation in the macOS System
  Preferences panel.

  - Cocoa: No native control
  - GTK: No native control; ``Gtk.HeaderBar`` in 3.10+
  - iOS: ``UINavigationBar`` + ``NavigationController``
  - Winforms: ?
  - Android: ?

Other capabilities
------------------

One of the aims of Toga is to provide a rich, feature-driven approach to
app development. This requires the development of APIs to support rich
features.

* **Preferences** - Support for saving app preferences, and visualizing them in a
  platform native way.

* **Notification** - A mechanism to display popup "toast"-style notifications

* **System tray icons** - Presenting an icon and/or menu in the platform's system tray -
  possibly without having a main app window at all.

* **Licensing/registration** - Monetization is not a bad thing, and shouldn't be
  mutually exclusive with open source.

* **Audio** - The ability to play sound files, either once off, or on a loop.

* **Cloud data access** - Traditional apps store all their files locally; however,
  using cloud services or network resources is increasingly common, especially in
  mobile apps. However, accessing cloud-based files can be very complicated; Toga
  is in a position to provide a file-like API that abstracts accessing these APIs.

* **QR code scanning** - The ability to scan QR codes and bar codes in an app, and
  return the encoded data.

Platforms
---------

Toga currently has good support for Cocoa on macOS, GTK on Linux, Winforms on Windows,
iOS and Android. Proof-of-concept support exists for single page web apps and consoles.
Support for a more modern Windows API would be desirable, as would support for Qt.
