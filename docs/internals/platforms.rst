The backend for OS X is named `toga-cocoa`_. It supports OS X 10.7 (Lion)
and later. It is installed automatically on OS X machines (machines that
report ``sys.platform == 'darwin'``), or can be manually installed by invoking::

    $ pip install toga[cocoa]

The OS X backend has seen the most development to date.

The backend for Linux platforms is named `toga-gtk`_. It supports GTK+ 3.4
and later. It is installed automatically on Linux machines (machines that
report ``sys.platform == 'linux'``), or can be manually installed by
invoking::

    $ pip install toga[gtk]

The GTK+ backend is reasonably well developed, but currently has some known issues
with widget layout.
