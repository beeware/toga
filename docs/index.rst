Toga
====

Toga is a Python native, OS native, cross platform GUI toolkit. Toga consists of a library of base components with a shared
interface to simplify platform-agnostic GUI development.

Toga is available on Mac OS, Windows, Linux (GTK), and mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.

Quickstart
==========

In your virtualenv, install Toga, and then run it::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window showing the full range of widgets available
to an application using Toga.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started, you can dive into our :doc:`Tutorials </tutorial/index>` or check out the widget :doc:`Reference </reference/index>`.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toga has some minimum requirements:

* If you're on OS X, you need to be on 10.7 (Lion) or newer.

* If you're on Linux, you need to have GTK+ 3.4 or later. This is the
  version that ships with Ubuntu 12.04; you'll need to have the
  ``python3-gi`` package installed. If you want to use the WebView widget,
  you'll also need to have WebKit, plus the GI bindings to WebKit
  (``gir1.2-webkit-3.0``) installed.

If these requirements aren't met, Toga either won't work at all, or won't
have full functionality.
