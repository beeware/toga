How to get started
==================

..  note:

    If you're new to Toga, we recommend starting with the :ref:`tutorial`, which will
    take you step-by-step through your first steps and introduce you to the important
    concepts you need to become familiar with. If you prefer just to dive in, read on.

Quickstart
==========

Create a new virtualenv. In your virtualenv, install Toga, and then run it::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window showing the full range of widgets available
to an application using Toga.

Have fun, and see the :ref:`reference` to learn more about what's going on.
