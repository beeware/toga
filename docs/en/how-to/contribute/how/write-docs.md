# Writing documentation

{% extends "contribute/how/write-docs.md" %}

{% block front_matter %}

Before you begin writing documentation, ensure you are able to [build the documentation](build-docs.md), and you are [working on a branch](branches.md).

{% endblock %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you are happy with your new documentation, you can [submit a pull request](submit-pr.md) with your proposed changes.
