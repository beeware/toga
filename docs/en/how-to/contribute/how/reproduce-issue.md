# Reproducing an issue

{% extends "contribute/how/reproduce-issue.md" %}

{% block front_matter %}

To begin reproducing an issue, you will need a [development environment](dev-environment.md) set up.

{% endblock %}

{% block end_matter %}

At this point, you might choose to try to [fix the issue](../what/fix-issue.md) you've just reproduced; alternatively, you can write up your findings and try to reproduce another issue.
