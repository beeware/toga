# Toga quick start  { #get-started }

Create a new virtual environment. In your virtual environment, install Toga, and then run it:

```console
$ python -m pip install toga-demo
$ toga-demo
```

This will pop up a GUI window showing the full range of widgets available to an application using Toga.

If you want to see how to write a Toga app of your own, you can [start the tutorial](tutorial-0.md).
