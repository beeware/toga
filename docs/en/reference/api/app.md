## Usage

The App class is the top level representation of all application activity. It is a singleton object - any given process can only have a single App. That application may manage multiple windows, but it will generally have at least one window (called the [`main_window`][toga.App.main_window]).

The application is started by calling [`main_loop()`][toga.App.main_loop]. This will invoke the [`startup()`][toga.App.startup] method of the app.

```python
import toga

app = toga.App("Simplest App", "com.example.simplest")
app.main_loop()
```

You can populate an app's main window by passing a callable as the `startup` argument to the [`toga.App`][] constructor. This `startup` method must return the content that will be added to the main window of the app.

```python
import toga

def create_content(app):
    return toga.Box(children=[toga.Label("Hello!")])

app = toga.App("Simple App", "com.example.simple", startup=create_content)
app.main_loop()
```

This approach to app construction is most useful with simple apps. For most complex apps, you should subclass [`toga.App`][], and provide an implementation of [`startup()`][toga.App.startup]. This implementation *must* assign a value to [`main_window`][toga.App.main_window] for the app. The possible values are [discussed below][assigning-main-window]; most apps will assign an instance of [`toga.MainWindow`][]:

```python
import toga

class MyApp(toga.App):
    def startup(self):
        self.main_window = toga.MainWindow()
        self.main_window.content = toga.Box(children=[`toga.Label("Hello!")])
        self.main_window.show()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = MyApp("Realistic App", "org.beeware.realistic")
    app.main_loop()
```

Every app must have a formal name (a human readable name), and an app ID (a machine-readable identifier - usually a reversed domain name). In the examples above, these are provided as constructor arguments. However, you can also provide these details, along with many of the other constructor arguments, as packaging metadata in a format compatible with [`importlib.metadata`][]. If you deploy your app with [Briefcase](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/stable), this will be done automatically.

A Toga app will install a number of default commands to reflect core application functionality (such as the Quit/Exit menu item, and the About menu item). The IDs for these commands are defined as constants on the [`Command`][toga.Command] class. These commands are automatically installed *before* [`startup()`][toga.App.startup] is invoked. If you wish to customize the menu items exposed by your app, you can add or remove commands in your [`startup()`][toga.App.startup] implementation.

## Assigning a main window  { #assigning-main-window }

An app *must* assign `main_window` as part of the startup process. However, the value that is assigned as the main window will affect the behavior of the app.

### `toga.Window`

Most apps will assign an instance of [`toga.Window`][] (or a subclass, such as [`toga.MainWindow`][]) as the main window. This window will control the life cycle of the app. When the window assigned as the main window is closed, the app will exit.

If you create an `App` by passing a `startup` argument to the constructor, a [`MainWindow`][toga.MainWindow] will be automatically created and assigned to `main_window`.

### `None`

If your app doesn't have a single "main" window, but instead has multiple windows that are equally important (e.g., a document editor, or a web browser), you can assign a value of `None` to [`main_window`][toga.App.main_window]. The resulting behavior is slightly different on each platform, reflecting platform differences.

On macOS, the app is allowed to continue running without having any open windows. The app can open and close windows as required; the app will keep running until explicitly exited. If you give the app focus when it has no open windows, a file dialog will be displayed prompting you to select a file to open. If the file is already open, the existing representation for the document will be given focus.

On Linux and Windows, when an app closes the last window it is managing, the app will automatically exit. Attempting to close the last window will trigger any app-level [`on_exit()`][toga.App.on_exit] handling in addition to any window-specific [`on_close()`][toga.Window.on_close] handling.

Mobile, web and console platforms *must* define a main window.

### `toga.App.BACKGROUND`

Assigning a value of [`toga.App.BACKGROUND`][] as the main window will allow your app to persist even if it doesn't have any open windows. It will also hide any app-level icon from your taskbar.

Background apps are not supported on mobile, web and console platforms.

## Life cycle of an app

Regardless of what an application does, every application goes through the same life cycle of starting, running, and shutting down.

Application startup is handled by the [`startup()`][toga.App.startup] method described above. [`startup()`][toga.App.startup] *cannot* be an asynchronous method, as it runs *before* the App's event loop is started.

All other events in the life cycle of the app can be managed with event handlers. [`toga.App`][] defines the following event handlers:

- [`on_running()`][toga.App.on_running] occurs as soon as the app's event loop has started.
- [`on_exit()`][toga.App.on_exit] occurs when the user tries to exit. The handler for this event must return a Boolean value: `True` if the app is allowed to exit; `False` otherwise. This allows an app to abort the exit process (for example, to prevent exit if there are unsaved changes).

Event handlers can be defined by subclassing [`toga.App`][] and overriding the event handler method, by assigning a value to the event handler when the app instance is constructed, or by assigning the event handler attribute on an existing app instance. When the event handler is set by assigning a value to the event handler, the handler method must accept an `app` argument. This argument is not required when subclassing, as the app instance can be implied. Regardless of how they are defined, event handlers *can* be defined as `async` methods.

## Managing documents

When you create an App instance, you can declare the type of documents that your app is able to manage by providing a value for `document_types`. When an app declares that it can manage document types, the app will automatically create file management menu items (such as New, Open and Save), and the app will process command line arguments, creating a [`toga.Document`][] instance for each argument matching a registered document type.

For details on how to define and register document types, refer to [the documentation on document handling](resources/document.md).

## Notes

- On macOS, menus are tied to the app, not the window; and a menu is mandatory. Therefore, a macOS app will *always* have a menu with the default menu items, regardless of the window being used as the main window.
- Apps executed under Wayland on Linux environment may not show the app's formal name correctly. Wayland considers many aspects of app operation to be the domain of the windowing environment, not the app; as a result, some API requests will be ignored under a Wayland environment. Correctly displaying the app's formal name requires the use of a desktop metadata that Wayland can read. Packaging your app with [Briefcase](https://briefcase.beeware.org/en/stable) is one way to produce this metadata.
