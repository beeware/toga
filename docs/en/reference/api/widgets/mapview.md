## Usage

A MapView is a scrollable area that can show a map at varying levels of detail, from nation-level to street level. The map can be centered at a given coordinate, and zoomed to the required level of detail using an integer from 0 (for global detail) to 20 (for building level detail):

```python
import toga

# Create a map centered in London, UK.
mapview = toga.MapView(location=(51.507222, -0.1275))

# Center the map in Perth, Australia
mapview.location = (-31.9559, 115.8606)

# Zoom to show the map to show street level detail
mapview.zoom = 15
```

A map can also display pins. A map pin must have a title, and can optionally have a subtitle. Pins can be added at time of map construction, or can be dynamically added, updated and removed at runtime:

```python
import toga

mapview = toga.MapView(
    pins=[
        toga.MapPin((-31.95064, 115.85889), title="Yagan Square"),
    ]
)

# Create a new pin, and add it to the map
brutus = toga.MapPin((41.50375, -81.69475), title="Brutus was here")
mapview.pins.add(brutus)

# Update the pin label and position
brutus.location = (40.440831, -79.991162)
brutus.title = "Brutus will be here"

# Remove the Brutus pin
mapview.pins.remove(brutus)

# Remove all pins
mapview.pins.clear()
```

Pins can respond to being pressed. When a pin is pressed, the map generates an `on_select` event, which receives the pin as an argument.

## System requirements  { #mapview-system-requires }

- Using MapView on Windows 10 requires that your users have installed the [Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download). This is installed by default on Windows 11.

- Using MapView on Linux requires that the user has installed the system packages for WebKit2, plus the GObject Introspection bindings for WebKit2. The name of the system package required is distribution dependent:
  - Ubuntu 20.04; Debian 11: `gir1.2-webkit2-4.0`
  - Ubuntu 22.04+; Debian 12+: `gir1.2-webkit2-4.1`
  - Fedora: `webkit2gtk4.1`
  - Arch/Manjaro: `webkit2gtk-4.1`
  - OpenSUSE Tumbleweed: `libwebkit2gtk3 typelib(WebKit2)`
  - FreeBSD: `webkit2-gtk3`

  MapView is not fully supported on GTK4. If you want to contribute to   the GTK4 MapView implementation, you will require v6.0 of the WebKit2   libraries. This is provided by `gir1.2-webkit-6.0` on Ubuntu/Debian,   and `webkitgtk6.0` on Fedora; for other distributions, consult your   distribution's platform documentation.

- Using MapView on Android requires the OSMDroid package in your project's Gradle dependencies. Ensure your app declares a dependency on `org\.osmdroid:osmdroid-android:6.1.20` or later.

## Notes

- The Android, GTK and Winforms implementations of MapView use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) as a source of map tiles. OpenStreetMap is an open data project with its own [copyright, license terms, and acceptable use policies](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright). If you make use of MapView in your application, it is your responsibility to ensure that your app complies with these terms. In addition, we strongly encourage you to financially support the [OpenStreetMap Foundation](https://osmfoundation.org), as their work is what allows Toga to provide map content on these platforms.
- On macOS and iOS, MapView will not repeat map tiles if the viewable area at the given zoom level is bigger than the entire world. A zoom to a very low level will be clipped to the lowest level that allows displaying the map without repeating tiles.
