Why Toga?
=========

Toga isn't the world's first widget toolkit - there are dozens of other
options. So why build a new one?

Native widgets - not themes
---------------------------

Toga uses native system widgets, not themes. When you see a Toga app running,
it doesn't just *look* like a native app - it *is* a native app. Applying an
operating system-inspired theme over the top of a generic widget set is an
easy way for a developer to achieve a cross-platform goal, but it leaves the
end user with the mess.

It's easy to spot apps that have been built using themed widget sets - they're
the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. Widgets don't look
*quite* right, or there's a menu bar on a window in an OS X app. Themes can
get quite close - but there are always telltale signs.

On top of that, native widgets are always faster than a themed generic widget.
After all, you're using native system capability that has been tuned and
optimized, not a drawing engine that's been layered on top of a generic widget.

Abstract the broad concepts
---------------------------

It's not enough to just look like a native app, though - you need to *feel*
like a native app as well.

A "Quit" option under a "File" menu makes sense if you're writing a Windows
app - but it's completely out of place if you're on OS X - the Quit option
should be under the application menu.

And besides - why did the developer have to code the location of a Quit option
anyway? Every app in the world has to have a quit option, so why doesn't the
widget toolkit provide a quit option pre-installed, out of the box?

Although Toga uses 100% native system widgets, that doesn't mean Toga is just
a wrapper around system widgets. Wherever possible, Toga attempts to abstract
the broader concepts underpinning the construction of GUI apps, and build an
API for *that*. So - every Toga app has the basic set of menu options you'd
expect of every app - Quit, About, and so on - all in the places you'd expect
to see them in a native app.

When it comes to widgets, sometimes the abstraction is simple - after all, a
button is a button, no matter what platform you're on. But other widgets may
not be exposed so literally. What the Toga API aims to expose is a set of
mechanisms for achieving UI goals, not a literal widget set.

Python native
-------------

Most widget toolkits start their life as a C or C++ layer, which is then
wrapped by other languages. As a result, you end up with APIs that taste
like C or C++.

Toga has been designed from the ground up to be a Python native widget
toolkit. This means the API is able to exploit language level features like
generators and context managers in a way that a wrapper around a C library
wouldn't be able to (at least, not easily).

This also means supporting Python 3, and 3 only because that's where the
future of Python is at.

`pip install` and nothing more
------------------------------

Toga aims to be no more than a `pip install` away from use. It doesn't require
the compilation of C extensions. There's no need to install a binary support
library. There's no need to change system paths and environment variables.
Just install it, import it, and start writing (or running) code.

Embrace mobile
--------------

10 years ago, being a cross-platform widget toolkit meant being available
for Windows, OS X and Linux. These days, mobile computing is much more
important. But despite this, there aren't many good options for Python
programming on mobile platforms, and cross-platform mobile coding is still
elusive. Toga aims to correct this.

So... why the name Toga?
========================

We all know the aphorism that `"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."`_

.. _"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.": http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/when_in_Rome_do_as_the_Romans_do

So - what does a well dressed Roman wear? A toga, of course! And what does a
well dressed Python app wear? Toga!

So... why the yak mascot?
=========================

It's a reflection of the long running joke about `yak shaving`_ in computer
programming. The story originally comes from MIT, and is related to a
Ren and Stimpy episode; over the years, the story has evolved, and now goes
something like this:

    You want to borrow your neighbours hose so you can wash your car. But you
    remember that last week, you broke their rake, so you need to go to the
    hardware store to buy a new one. But that means driving to the hardware
    store, so you have to look for your keys. You eventually find your keys
    inside a tear in a cushion - but you can't leave the cushion torn,
    because the dog will destroy the cushion if they find a little tear. The
    cushion needs a little more stuffing before it can be repaired, but it's
    a special cushion filled with exotic Tibetan yak hair.

    The next thing you know, you're standing on a hillside in Tibet shaving a
    yak. And all you wanted to do was wash your car.

An easy to use widget toolkit is the yak standing in the way of progress of a
number of PyBee_ projects, and the original creator of Toga has been tinkering
with various widget toolkits for over 20 years, so the metaphor seemed
appropriate.

Enough theory (and bad puns...) - let's get started with your first Toga app!
