=======================
Let's draw on a canvas!

    Want to help out? Maybe you could port the Canvas widget to other platforms?

One of the main capabilities needed to create many types of GUI applications is
the ability to draw and manipulate lines, shapes, text, and other graphics. To
do this in Toga, we use the Canvas Widget.

Utilizing the Canvas is easy as determining the drawing operations you want to
perform, placing them in a function, and then creating a new Canvas while
passing the function to the on_draw parameter.

1. We first define the drawing operations we want to perform in a new function::

     def draw_tiberius(self, canvas, context):
        self.canvas.set_context(context)
        self.fill_head()

The function you want to draw with should also be defined to include canvas and
context arguments, and make use of the set_context method.

2. Next we create a new Canvas, and pass in the draw_tiberius method::

    self.canvas = toga.Canvas(on_draw=self.draw_tiberius)

That's all there is to! In this example we also add our canvas to the MainWindow
through use of the Box Widget::

        box = toga.Box(children=[self.canvas])
        self.main_window.content = box

You'll also notice in the full example below that some of the drawing operations
use the "with" keyword to utilize context managers including closed_path, fill,
and stroke. This reduces the repetition of commands while utilizing these basic
drawing capabilities.

Here's the source code

.. literalinclude:: /../examples/tutorial4/tutorial/app.py
   :language: python

Although not shown in this tutorial, it is also possible to directly do simple
draw operations without passing in the on_draw callable function.

In this example, we see a new Toga widget - :class:`.Canvas`.
