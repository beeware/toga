A Qt backend for the [Toga widget toolkit](https://beeware.org/toga).

This package isn\'t much use by itself; it needs to be combined with
[the core Toga library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-core).

For platform requirements, see the Qt platform documentation (TODO).

For more details, see the [Toga project on
GitHub](https://github.com/beeware/toga).
