Toga
====

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

This package provides the core Toga API. In order to use Toga, you'll also need to
install a backend that implements the core Toga API for that platform:

* **Android** `toga-android <https://pypi.org/project/toga-android>`__
* **iOS** `toga-iOS <https://pypi.org/project/toga-iOS>`__
* **Linux** `toga-gtk <https://pypi.org/project/toga-gtk>`__
* **macOS** `toga-cocoa <https://pypi.org/project/toga-cocoa>`__
* **Web** `toga-web <https://pypi.org/project/toga-web>`__
* **Windows** `toga-winforms <https://pypi.org/project/toga-winforms>`__

Minimum requirements
--------------------

Toga requires **Python 3.8** or newer. Python 2 is not supported.

Each backend also has specific requirements and pre-requisites. See the `platform
documentation <https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/platforms.html>`__ for
details.
