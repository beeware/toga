        The App is the manager of all the other aspects of execution. An app will
        usually have a main window; this window will hold the widgets with which the
        user will interact.

        When you create an App you need to provide a name, an id for uniqueness (by
        convention, the identifier is a reversed domain name) and an optional startup
        function which should run once the App has initialized. The startup function
        constructs the initial user interface. If a startup function is not provided as
        an argument, you must subclass the App class and define a ``startup()`` method.

        If the name and app_id are *not* provided, the application will attempt to find
        application metadata. This process will determine the module in which the App
        class is defined, and look for a ``.dist-info`` file matching that name.

        Once the app is created you should invoke the ``main_loop()`` method, which will
        start the event loop of your App.

        :param formal_name: The formal name of the application. Will be derived from
            packaging metadata if not provided.
        :param app_id: The unique application identifier. This will usually be a
            reversed domain name, e.g. ``org.beeware.myapp``. Will be derived from
            packaging metadata if not provided.
        :param app_name: The name of the Python module containing the app. Will be
            derived from the module defining the instance of the App class if not
            provided.
        :param id: The DOM identifier for the app (optional)
        :param icon: Identifier for the application's icon.
        :param author: The person or organization to be credited as the author of the
            application. Will be derived from application metadata if not provided.
        :param version: The version number of the app. Will be derived from packaging
            metadata if not provided.
        :param home_page: A URL for a home page for the app. Used in auto-generated help
            menu items. Will be derived from packaging metadata if not provided.
        :param description: A brief (one line) description of the app. Will be derived
            from packaging metadata if not provided.
        :param startup: The callback method before starting the app, typically to add
            the components. Must be a ``callable`` that expects a single argument of
            :class:`~toga.App`.
        :param windows: An iterable with objects of :class:`~toga.Window` that will be
