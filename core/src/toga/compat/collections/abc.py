# MicroPython apparently doesn't provide any way to create an object T such that both
# `T` and `T[args]` evaluate to a usable type object:
#
# * Regular classes don't accept [] syntax.
# * __class_getitem__ isn't supported at all.
# * A metaclass with a __getitem__ method can be instantiated into a class, but that
#   class can't be used as the base of another class.
#
# This doesn't matter in type annotations, because they aren't evaluated anyway, but it
# does matter for declarations such as `class DocumentSet(Sequence[Document])`. So we
# prioritize the [] syntax to support that.
#
# This means that expressions like `isinstance(x, Sequence)` won't work, and will need
# to be replaced with hasattr checks. But that would probably be necessary anyway,
# because I don't think MicroPython has enough ABC support for even a standard list to
# be treated as an instance of Sequence.
#
# This approach should also allow our ABCs to include a proper inheritance hierarchy and
# mixin methods, once that becomes necessary.
