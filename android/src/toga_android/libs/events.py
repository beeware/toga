class AndroidEventLoop(asyncio.SelectorEventLoop):
    # `AndroidEventLoop` exists to support starting the Python event loop cooperatively with
    # the built-in Android event loop. Since it's cooperative, it has a `run_forever_cooperatively()`
    # method which returns immediately. This is is different from the parent class's `run_forever()`,
    # which blocks.
    #
    # In some cases, for simplicity of implementation, this class reaches into the internals of the
    # parent and grandparent classes.
    #
    # A Python event loop handles two kinds of tasks. It needs to run delayed tasks after waiting
    # the right amount of time, and it needs to do I/O when file descriptors are ready for I/O.
    #
    # `SelectorEventLoop` uses an approach we **cannot** use: it calls the `select()` method
    # to block waiting for specific file descriptors to be come ready for I/O, or a timeout
    # corresponding to the soonest delayed task, whichever occurs sooner.
    #
    # To handle delayed tasks, `AndroidEventLoop` asks the Android event loop to wake it up when
    # its soonest delayed task is ready. To accomplish this, it relies on a `SelectorEventLoop`
    # implementation detail: `_scheduled` is a collection of tasks sorted by soonest wakeup time.
    #
    # To handle waking up when it's possible to do I/O, `AndroidEventLoop` will register file descriptors
    # with the Android event loop so the platform can wake it up accordingly. It does not do this yet.
