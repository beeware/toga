toga
====

A meta-package for installing the `Toga widget toolkit`_.

This package installs the `toga-core <https://pypi.org/project/toga-core>`__ library,
plus a different Toga backend depending the platform where it is installed:

* `toga-cocoa <https://pypi.org/project/toga-cocoa>`__ on macOS
* `toga-gtk <https://pypi.org/project/toga-gtk>`__ on Linux and FreeBSD
* `toga-winforms <https://pypi.org/project/toga-winforms>`__ on Windows

Backends are also available for `Android <https://pypi.org/project/toga-android>`__,
`iOS <https://pypi.org/project/toga-iOS>`__, `single-page web apps
<https://pypi.org/project/toga-web>`__, and `testing
<https://pypi.org/project/toga-dummy>`__; however, these must be installed manually.

Toga requires **Python 3.8** or newer. It does not support Python 2. Some platforms have
additional prerequisites; see the `Toga platform guide
<https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/index.html>`__ for details.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.
