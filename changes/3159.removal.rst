The signature of the ``apply`` method of ``BaseStyle`` (and thus ``Pack``) has changed. Rather than taking a property name and value, it now takes only the name, and the style object checks its own current value for that property to know what to apply. This method is normally used internally, but any user code calling it manually will get a ``DeprecationWarning`` if it supplies two arguments.
