The specification for Tree/Table column data has historically documented that an icon in a column is specified with a 2-tuple. However, on some platforms, the implementation has allowed n-tuples and/or other collection types. This has now been constrained - a 2-tuple is the *only* way to specify an icon for column data; and using a tuple of any length other than 2 will raise an error.
