The behaviour of the Canvas widget when a drawing was scaled by a factor of 0 in either axis was unspecified and varied across backends and HTML Canvas implementations.  The Canvas widget now follows the behavior of macOS and iOS. On some backends a very small scale factor is used instead when asked to scale by 0.
