The behaviour of the Canvas widget when a drawing was scaled by a factor of 0 in either axis was unspecified and varied across backends and HTML Canvas implementations.  The Canvas widget now follows a consistent, reasonable behavior when this happens which should produce similar results on all backends. On some backends, to avoid errors or other drawing problems, a very small scale factor is used instead of 0 when asked to scale by 0.
