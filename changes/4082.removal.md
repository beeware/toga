- The class `toga.widgets.canvas.Context` has been renamed from `Context` to `State`.
- `Context`'s `Context()` method has also been renamed to `state()`.
- The `context` property of `Canvas` has been renamed to `root_context`.
- `toga.widgets.canvas.DrawingObject` has been renamed from `DrawingObject` to `DrawingAction`.
  This is an internal class, and is unlikely to be used directly.

The previous names still work, but will raise a `DeprecationWarning`.
