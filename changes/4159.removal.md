There are a number of changes to the Canvas widget's drawing API:
  - Drawing methods can now be called directly on a Canvas. Calling them on States is now deprecated.
  - The CamelCase context-manager drawing methods are deprecated; they are now unified with their standalone counterparts. For example, the `fill` method (lowercase) can be used as a normal method or as `with canvas.fill():`.
  - List-like methods on States are deprecated; manipulate their `State.drawing_actions` lists directly.
  - `State.redraw()` is deprecated; call `Canvas.redraw()` instead.
  - States no longer hold a reference to their Canvas; the `State.canvas` attribute is deprecated. (This is largely an internal detail, and unlikely to affect user code.)
