Pack's ``padding`` and ``alignment`` properties have been renamed to ``margin`` and ``align_items``, to match their CSS analogues. ``align_items`` also now takes CSS-compatible values of ``START``, ``CENTER``, and ``END``, instead of ``alignment``'s' ``TOP``/``RIGHT``/``BOTTOM``/``LEFT``/``CENTER``. The old names are still present — and ``alignment`` still takes its existing values — but these are deprecated.
