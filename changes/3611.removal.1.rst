Previously, Travertino provided an ``rgba`` and an ``hsla`` class, as well as ``rgb`` and ``hsl`` subclasses that enforce opaque alpha. In order to better match CSS, there is now no difference between these names; the shorter ``rgb`` and ``hsl`` are the preferred forms, but ``rgba`` and ``hsla`` are direct aliases for them. This can have backwards-incompatible implications; for instance, ``rgba(255, 255, 255, .5).rgb`` would previously have returned a fully opaque ``rgb`` instance, while now it will preserve its alpha channel information.
