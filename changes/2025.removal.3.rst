The handling of row deletion in DetailedList widgets has been significantly altered. The ``on_delete`` event handler has been renamed ``on_primary_action``, and is now *only* a notification that a "swipe left" event (or platform equivalent) has been confirmed. This was previously inconsistent across platforms. Some platforms would update the data source to remove the row; some treated ``on_delete`` as a notification event and expected the application to handle the deletion. It is now the application's responsibility to perform the data deletion.
