A Canvas is no longer implicitly a context object. The ``Canvas.context`` property now returns the root context of the canvas. If you were previously using ``Canvas.context()`` to generate an empty context, it should be replaced with ``Canvas.Context()``. Any operations to ``remove()`` drawing objects from the canvas or ``clear()`` the canvas of drawing objects should be made on ``Canvas.context``. Invoking these methods on ``Canvas`` will now call the base ``Widget`` implementations, which will throw an exception because ``Canvas`` widgets cannot have children.
