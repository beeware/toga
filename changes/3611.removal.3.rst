``rgb`` and ``hsl`` color objects are now read-only; their ``r``/``g``/``b``/``a`` or ``h``/``s``/``l``/``a`` attributes can't be altered after creation. Because of this, format conversions (``rgb(...).hsl`` or ``hsl(...).rgb``) can now cache their results, only performing calculations once. "Converting" a color object to its own type (``rgb(...).rgb`` or ``hsl(...).hsl``) now returns the original object, rather than a new instance with the same values.
