The parsing function `travertino.colors.color()` (also accessible as `toga.colors.color()`) is deprecated. The Travertino method has been renamed `travertino.colors.Color.parse()`. There should be no need to use this method in Toga, as all APIs that accept colors will automatically parse of raw color representations from strings.
