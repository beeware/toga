The ``parent`` argument has been removed from the ``insert`` and ``append`` calls on ``TreeSource``. This improves consistency between the API for ``TreeSource`` and the API for ``list``. To insert or append a row in to a descendent of a TreeSource root, use ``insert`` and ``append`` on the parent node itself - i.e., ``source.insert(parent, index, ...)`` becomes ``parent.insert(index, ...)``, and ``source.insert(None, index, ...)`` becomes ``source.insert(index, ...)``.
