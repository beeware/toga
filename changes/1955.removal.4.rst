The ``insert`` and ``append`` APIs on ``ListSource`` and ``TreeSource`` have been
modified to provide an interface that is closer to that ``list`` API. These methods
previously accepted a variable list of positional and keyword arguments; these arguments
should be combined into a single tuple or dictionary. This matches the API provided by
``__setitem__()``.
