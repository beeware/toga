If you're running on Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 11 or Debian 12, you'll need to manually add a pin for ``PyGObject==3.50.0`` to your project. This is because recent PyGObject releases specify a requirement on ``girepository-2.0``, which is not available on older Debian-based distributions. A manual pin is required because there's no way to express a dependency on a system package as part of Python's requirements specifications.
