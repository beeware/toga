# Implementation notes:
#
# GDK/GTK renders everything at 96dpi. When HiDPI mode is enabled, it is managed
# at the compositor level. See
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#GDK_3_(GTK_3) for details.
#
# GTK3 and GTK4 have different layout mechanisms; GTK3 uses a Gtk.Fixed-based
# layout, where the widget forces the position of children as part of the layout
# process. GTK4 uses a Gtk.LayoutManager to perform layout. However, the actual
# layouts *should* be effectively the same.
