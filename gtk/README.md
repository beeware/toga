A GTK backend for the [Toga widget toolkit](https://beeware.org/toga). It uses the GTK 3 API by default; GTK 4 support is experimental, and can be enabled by defining `TOGA_GTK=4` in your shell environment.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with [the core Toga library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-core).

For platform requirements, see the [GTK platform documentation](https://toga.beeware.org/en/latest/reference/platforms/linux/gtk#prerequisites).

For more details, see [Toga's documentation](https://toga.beeware.org), or the [Toga project on GitHub](https://github.com/beeware/toga).
