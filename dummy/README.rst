toga-dummy
==========

An Dummy backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_. This doesn't actually display
anything; it exists purely as a testing environment.

**Toga requires Python 3**

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the core Toga library`_,

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.
