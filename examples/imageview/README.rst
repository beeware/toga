ImageView
=========

Test app for the ImageView widget. The app adds two image views
in a Box layout.

The top image view has an image loaded from a local path. Style
parameters are set for height and width.

The bottom image view has an image loaded from a remote URL. No
style parameters are set so Pack should figure out how to use
the remaining space.

Quickstart

To run this example:

    $ python -m imageview
