Beeliza
=======

In 1964, an MIT researcher named Joseph Weizenbaum developed one of the
world's first chat bots - Eliza. Eliza simulated conversation using a "pattern
matching" approach, where inputs are matched against a set of scripts, and
responses chosen in response. The best known of these "scripts" is DOCTOR,
which simulates a session with a Rogerian psychotherapist.

This app provides a bee-themed Eliza experience: a chat session, in a
native app, where Brutus the Bee is your conversation partner.
