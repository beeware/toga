# Tree Source

An example of using a
[custom data source with a Tree widget](https://toga.beeware.org/en/stable/reference/api/resources/sources/tree_source.html).

This is similar to Tree; but instead of using dictionaries and lists,
the code provides a custom data source that wraps the file/folder names
and dates of the current directory. This is a more realistic example of
what you'd do in practice with a tree.

## Quickstart

To run this example:

```
$ python -m pip install toga
$ python -m tree_source
```
