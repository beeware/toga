Tree Source
===========

An example of using a custom data source with a tree.

This is the same example as Tree; but instead of using dictionaries and lists,
the code provides a custom data source that wraps the concept of decades and
movies. This is a more realistic example of what you'd do in practice with a tree.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

To run this example:

    $ pip install toga
    $ python -m tree_source
