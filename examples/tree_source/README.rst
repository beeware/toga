Tree Source
===========

An example of using a custom data source with a tree.

This is a similar as Tree; but instead of using dictionaries and lists, the
code provides a custom data source that wraps the file/folder names and dates
of the current directory. This is a more realistic example of what you'd do in
practice with a tree.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

To run this example:

    $ python -m tree_source
