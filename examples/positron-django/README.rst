This is an example of an Electron-style "web site as app" project.

It serves a Django site called ``webapp``, contained in ``src/webapp``. The
contents of this folder are a stock version of what is produced by
``django-admin.py startproject``, collapsed into a single directory.

Getting started
---------------

To set up a development environment::

    $ python -m venv venv
    $ ./venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install briefcase

To run Django management commands::

    (venv) PYTHONPATH=src python src/manage.py

To run in development mode::

    (venv) $ briefcase dev

To run as a packaged app::

    (venv) $ briefcase run

The Django app will run on a SQLite3 database, stored in the user's data directory (the
location of this directory is platform specific). This database file will be created if
it doesn't exist, and migrations will be run on every app start.

If you need to start the database with some initial content (e.g., an initial user
login) you can use ``manage.py`` to create an initial database file. If there is a
``db.sqlite3`` in the ``src/positron/resources`` folder when the app starts, and the
user doesn't already have a ``db.sqlit3`` file in their app data folder, the initial
database file will be copied into the user's data folder as a starting point.

To create an initial database, use ``manage.py`` - e.g.,:

    (venv) PYTHONPATH=src python src/manage.py migrate
    (venv) PYTHONPATH=src python src/manage.py createsuperuser

This will create an initial ``db.sqlite3`` file with a superuser account. All users of
the app will have this superuser account in their database.
