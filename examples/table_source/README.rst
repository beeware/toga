Table Source
============

An example of using a custom data source with a table.

This is the same example as Table; but instead of using lists, the code
provides a custom data source that wraps the concept of movies. This is a more
realistic example of what you'd do in practice with a table.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

To run this example:

    $ python -m table_source
