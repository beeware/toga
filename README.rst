Toga
====

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toga has some minimum requirements:

* Toga requires **Python 3**. Python 2 is not supported.

* If you're on macOS, you need to be on 10.7 (Lion) or newer.

* If you're on Linux, you need to have GTK+ 3.10 or later. This is the version
  that ships starting with Ubuntu 14.04 and Fedora 20. You also need to install
  the Python 3 bindings to GTK+. If you want to use the WebView widget, you'll
  also need to have WebKit, plus the GI bindings to WebKit installed. This means
  you'll need to install the following:

  * **Ubuntu 14.04** ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-3.0``

  * **Ubuntu 16.04** ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-4.0``
    or ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-3.0``

  * **Debian 8** ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-3.0``

  * **Fedora** ``dnf install python3-gobject pywebkitgtk``
    or ``yum install python3-gobject pywebkitgtk`` 

If these requirements aren't met, Toga either won't work at all, or won't have
full functionality.

Quickstart
----------
