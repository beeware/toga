toga-gtk
========

A GTK+ backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_.

** Toga requires Python 3 **

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the core Toga library`_.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This backend requires GTK+ 3.4 as a minimum. This is the version provided
out of the box by Ubunutu 12.04, in the ``python-gi`` (or ``python3-gi``,
if you're using Python 3) package.

If you want to use a WebView, you'll also need to have WebKit, plus the
GI bindings to WebKit (``gir1.2-webkit2-3.0``) installed.
