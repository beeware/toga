Tailor
======

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Quickstart
----------

In your virtualenv, install Tailor, and then run it::

    $ pip install tailor
    $ tailor

This will pop up a GUI window.

Problems under Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu's packaging of Python omits the ``idlelib`` library from it's base
packge. If you're using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 13.04, you can install
``idlelib`` by running::

    $ sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7

For other versions of Python and Ubuntu, you'll need to adjust this as
appropriate.

Problems under Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're running Tailor in a virtualenv, you'll need to set an
environment variable so that Tailor can find the TCL graphics library::

    $ set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\Python27\tcl\tcl8.5

You'll need to adjust the exact path to reflect your local Python install.
You may find it helpful to put this line in the ``activate.bat`` script
for your virtual environment so that it is automatically set whenever the
virtualenv is activated.
