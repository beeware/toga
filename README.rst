toga-win32
==========

A Win32 (Microsoft Windows) backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_.

**THIS MODULE IS A PRE-ALPHA** - it does not yet have all the widgets needed to
run the Toga demonstration program.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `toga-core`_.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.
