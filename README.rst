Toga
====

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minimum requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Toga requires **Python 3**. Python 2 is not supported.

* If you're on macOS, you need to be on 10.7 (Lion) or newer.

* If you're on Linux, you need to have GTK+ 3.10 or later. This is the version
  that ships starting with Ubuntu 14.04 and Fedora 20. You also need to install
  the Python 3 bindings to GTK+.
  
* We're working on Windows support, but not all features and widgets are supported. At a minimum, you'll need Python 3 and .NET Framework 4. This has been tested on Windows 10, but should work on 7 and 8. Pull requests, help and corrections are most welcome.
  
Optional extras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to use the WebView widget, you'll
also need to have WebKit, plus the GI bindings to WebKit installed. This means
you'll need to install the following:
  * **Ubuntu 14.04** ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-3.0``

  * **Ubuntu 16.04 / Debian 8** ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-4.0``
    or ``apt-get install python3-gi gir1.2-webkit-3.0``

  * **Fedora** ``dnf install python3-gobject pywebkitgtk``
    or ``yum install python3-gobject pywebkitgtk`` 
    
Other distros should be similar, but feel free to send a pull request with updated dependencies if needed.

If these requirements aren't met, Toga either won't work at all, or won't have
full functionality.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
