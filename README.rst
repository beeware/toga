A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Minimum requirements
--------------------

* Toga requires **Python 3.9 or higher**.

* If you're on macOS, you need to be on 11 (Big Sur) or newer.

* If you're on Windows, you'll need Windows 10 or newer. If you are using
  Windows 10 and want to use a WebView to display web content, you will also
  need to install the `Edge WebView2 Evergreen Runtime
  <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section>`__.
  Windows 11 has this runtime installed by default.

* If you're on Linux (or another Unix-based operating system), you need to have
  GTK+ >= 3.24 and glib >= 2.64. These are available starting with Ubuntu 20.04 and
  Fedora 32. You also need to install the system packages listed in `Linux platform
  documentation <https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/linux.html#prerequisites>`__.
