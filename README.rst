Minimum requirements
--------------------

* Toga requires **Python 3.8 or higher**. Python 2 is not supported.

* If you're on macOS, you need to be on 11 (Big Sur) or newer.

* If you're on Windows, you'll need Windows 10 or newer. If you are using
  Windows 10 and want to use a WebView to display web content, you will also
  need to install the `Edge WebView2 Evergreen
  Runtime. <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section>`__
  Windows 11 has this runtime installed by default.

* If you're on Linux (or another Unix-based operating system), you need to have
  GTK+ 3.10 or newer. This is the version that ships starting with Ubuntu 14.04
  and Fedora 20. You also need to install the system packages listed
  in `Tutorial 0 <docs/tutorial/tutorial-0.rst>`__.
