# toga-positron

A [Briefcase](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase) bootstrap for setting up
[Toga](https://github.com/beeware/toga) apps whose GUI generated by displaying web
content. (i.e., Electron-like apps... but more positive, because they're using Python!)

## Usage

Create a fresh virtual environment, then install `toga-positron`. This will install
Briefcase, plus the Positron bootstrap. You can then use the Briefcase wizard to create
a new Toga app:

    $ python -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install toga-positron
    (venv) $ briefcase new

This will ask you a number of questions about the app you want to generate, such as the
app's name, the authors name, and the project license. You'll then be asked which GUI
framework you want to use:

    GUI framework [1]:

This provides 3 options for a Toga Positron-based app:

### Django server

An app that runs a Django web server in a background thread, and points the app's web
browser at the URL for that server.

### Site-specific browser

An app that behaves as a web browser that displays a single, externally served URL.

If you select this option, you will be asked for the URL that you want to display in the
app window. For example, if you nominate `https://github.com` as the site URL, you will
generate an app that, when started, loads the Github homepage.

### Static server

An app that runs a simple HTTP server on a background thread, and points the app's web
browser at the URL for that server. This is suitable for serving simple static HTML and
CSS content. The app will serve the contents of the app's `resources` folder (i.e.,
`src/<app name>/resources`) as the root URL. A placeholder `index.html` file is generated
as part of the template.
