toga-web
========

A backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_ on web platforms.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the core Toga library`_.

For platform requirements, see the `Web platform documentation
<https://toga.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/platforms/web.html#prerequisites>`__.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.
