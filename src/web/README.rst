toga-web
========

A common backend for the `Toga widget toolkit`_ on web platforms.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the
core Toga library`_, and a wrapper providing integration with a web framework:

* `Django <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-django>`__
* `Flask <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-flask>`__

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github`_.

Community
---------

Toga is part of the `BeeWare suite`_. You can talk to the community through:

* `@pybeeware on Twitter`_

* The `beeware/general`_ channel on Gitter.
