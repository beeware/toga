toga-flask
==========

A `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com>`__ backend for the `Toga widget
toolkit <https://beeware.org/toga>`__.

This package isn't much use by itself; it needs to be combined with `the core
Toga library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-core>`__ and `the Toga Web
library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/toga-web>`__.

For more details, see the `Toga project on Github
<https://github.com/beeware/toga>`__.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This backend requires Flask 1.1 as a minimum requirement.

Usage
~~~~~

Toga Flask defines a ``TogaApp`` class that can be used to mount a Toga Web
instance in a Flask app. If you have Toga application named `myapp`, Flask
deployment is acheived by putting the following into ``flaskapp.py``::

    from flask import Flask
    flask_app = Flask(__name__)

    from toga_flask import TogaApp

    from myapp import app

    TogaApp(app).route(flask_app, '/')

This will mount the Toga app at `/`. You can mount the app at any URL you wish,
and you can also add other routes for other views.

The app can then be executed with::

    $ FLASK_APP=flaskapp.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run

This assumes a standard Toga app layout, where the application `myapp` has a
submodule `app.py` that defines a `main()` method.
