Toga
====

A Python native, OS native GUI toolkit.

Quickstart
----------

To get a demonstration of the capabilities of Toga, run the following::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window with some sample widgets.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toga has some minimum requirements:

* If you're on OS X, you need to be on 10.10 (Yosemite) or newer.

* If you're on Linux, you need to have GTK+ 3.4 or later. This is the version
  that ships starting with Ubuntu 12.04 and Fedora 17.

* If you want to use the WebView widget, you'll also need to have WebKit, plus
  the GI bindings to WebKit installed.

    * For Ubuntu that's provided by the (``libwebkitgtk-3.0-0``) and
      (``gir1.2-webkit-3.0``) packages.

    * For Fedora it's all provided in the (``webkitgtk3``) package.

If these requirements aren't met, Toga either won't work at all, or won't have
full functionality.


Problems with source installs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internally, Toga is comprised of a number of subpackages - one for each
platform it supports. If you install using wheels, the install process will
correctly identify the required packages and install them. However, if you
install from source using pip, there is a `known bug in pip`_ that causes
dependencies to not be installed. It may be necessary to manually install
the following pre-requisites:

* OS X: ``pip install toga-cocoa``
* Linux: ``pip install toga-gtk toga-cassowary cassowary``
* Win32: ``pip install toga-win32 toga-cassowary cassowary``

.. _known bug in pip: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1951

Problems using virtualenv under Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running under Linux, Toga uses the system native python GTK+3 bindings
for display purposes. However, if you're using a ``--no-site-packages``
virtualenv, the Python bindings for GTK won't be in your ``PYTHONPATH``.

Unfortunately, you can't ``pip install`` GTK+ bindings, so you have to use a
workaround. To make the system GTK+ bindings available to your virtualenv,
symlink the ``gi`` module from the system dist-packages directory into your
virtualenv's site-packages::

    For a Ubuntu 32bit system (assuming Python 3.5)::

        $ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.5/site-packages
        $ ln -si /usr/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/gi

    For a Fedora 64bit system (assuming Python 3.5)::

        $ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.5/site-packages
        $ ln -si /usr/lib64/python3.5/site-packages/gi/

This package is a top level package. It depends on the use of platform-specific
backends to provide real functionality:

* ``toga-cocoa``: for macOS
* ``toga-gtk``: GTK+ backend for Linux desktops
* ``toga-iOS``: for iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod)
* ``toga-android``: for Android devices (limited support)
* ``toga-winforms``: for recent Window devices (limited support)
* ``toga-django``: for web deployment (limited support)
