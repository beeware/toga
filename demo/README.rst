**Toga requires Python 3**

.. _Toga widget toolkit: https://beeware.org/toga

Quickstart
----------

For details of Toga's pre-requisites, see the `Toga project on GitHub`_.

Once those pre-requisites have been met, in your virtualenv, install Toga Demo,
and then run it::

    $ pip install toga-demo
    $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window.

If you have cloned the toga repository, install the dependent packages in your virtualenv::

    $ cd toga
    $ pip install -e ./core

Then install the platform specific code::

    $ pip install -e ./cocoa      # macOS
    $ pip install -e ./gtk        # Linux
    $ pip install -e ./winforms   # Windows

Finally navigate to the demo directory and run the application::

    $ cd demo
    $ python -m toga_demo
