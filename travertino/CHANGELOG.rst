0.5.0 (2025-??-??)
==================

Features
--------

* Validated properties of styles can now be defined as dataclass class attributes. (`#141 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/141>`_)
* BaseStyle now supports ``|``, ``|=``, and ``in`` operators. (`#143 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/143>`_)
* A ``list_property`` declaration has been added to support storing multi-valueds style elements. (`#148 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/148>`_)
* Support for Python 3.13 was added. (`#149 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/149>`_)
* Support for Python 3.14 was added. (`#223 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/223>`_)
* The constants ``START`` and ``END`` have been added. (`#241 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/241>`_)

Bugfixes
--------

* Assigning a new style object to a node that already has an applicator assigned now properly maintains an association between the applicator and the new style, and triggers a style reapplication. (`#224 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/224>`_)
* Equality checks between a Font object and a non-Font object will now throw an exception instead of returning False. (`#233 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/233>`_)

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

* The `default` parameter for Choice has been deprecated. (`#139 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/139>`_)
* Python 3.8 is no longer supported. (`#223 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/223>`_)
* The mechanisms for assigning styles and applicators to nodes, and applying styles, have been reworked. A node will now attempt to apply its style as soon as it is assigned an applicator. This means you should not assign an applicator to a node until the node is sufficiently initialized to apply its style. To accommodate uses that currently do not follow this order, any exceptions resulting from a failed style application are caught, and a runtime warning is issued. In a future version, this will be an exception. (`#224 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/224>`_)
* Supplying an applicator to BaseStyle.copy() has been deprecated. If you need to manually assign an applicator to a style, do it separately, after the copy. (`#224 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/224>`_)
* The API for ``Style.layout()`` has been formally specified as part of the Travertino API. The initial ``node`` argument is no longer required as part of the ``layout()`` method. A ``Style`` instance can interrogate ``self._applicator.node`` to retrieve the node to which the style is being applied. (`#244 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/244>`_)


Documentation
-------------

* The README badges were updated to display correctly on GitHub. (`#170 <https://github.com/beeware/travertino/issues/170>`_)
